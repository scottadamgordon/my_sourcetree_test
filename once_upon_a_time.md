# Prelude

Once upon a time, there was a little Markdown file stored on GitHub. Lots of things happened in its lifetime. In the upcoming chapters, we'll look at some of them. 

# Chapter 1
The Markdown file begins its life with new branch, chapter1md. It doesn't know if it will see good fortune, or bad fortune, and the road is long. The chapter1.md branch is changed, and changes are commited, with a note to say what they contained.  

# Chapter 2

The chapter2.md branch was born, though it knew not what would be contained in chapter1.md. The branch was born from the master file, you see. In future, the content of chapters 1, 2, and 3 should have already been outlined somewhere, so that they would make one cohesive story, when they were eventually merged into the master branch. Until then, this is what we have. 

But wait, perhaps we can pull chapter 1 into chapter 2 already... to see how the plot is developing...

# Chapter 3

Chapter 3 wants to get started, but it thinks that the information in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 could be *vital* to its endeavors.  

Fortune is in chapter 1 and 3s favor, they were merged successfully. Chapter 2 is still blowing in the wind. But for how long?

Chapter 2 joins. Now we just need them all in the master file. Is it possible?
