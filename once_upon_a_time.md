# Prelude

Once upon a time, there was a little Markdown file stored on GitHub. Lots of things happened in its lifetime. In the upcoming chapters, we'll look at some of them. 

# Chapter 1
The Markdown file begins its life with new branch, chapter1md. It doesn't know if it will see good fortune, or bad fortune, and the road is long. The chapter1.md branch is changed, and changes are commited, with a note to say what they contained.  

# Chapter 2

# Chapter 3

Chapter 3 wants to get started, but it thinks that the information in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 could be *vital* to its endeavors.  

Fortune is in chapter 1 and 3s favor, they were merged successfully. Chapter 2 is still blowing in the wind. But for how long?
